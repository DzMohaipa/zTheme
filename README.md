# zTheme
zTheme converts iOS themes into macOS Theme Kit Themes

# Installation

Download zTheme

# Usage

```bash
# Only do this the first time.
chmod +x zTheme

./zTheme
```

# What it does

zTheme takes a list of bundle ids from this repository and scans the pre-existing iOS Theme for matching bundle ids and replaces it with the corresponding macOS bundle id if it is known.

zTheme requires the DEB file of the iOS theme to work.

zTheme will output into a folder called zTheme on your desktop.

# Built for macOS and [ThemeKit](https://github.com/MTACS/ThemeKit)
